# Specification Quality Checklist: Monthly charts and insights

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Defaults chosen without asking (candidates for `/speckit-clarify`): a previous month with no
  transactions shows "No data from last month to compare" instead of comparing against 0; trend
  months with no data are marked "No data" instead of drawn as zero; percents round half away from
  zero.
- User Story 4 (month picker) was added at the developer's request after the first review; it
  supersedes 001 FR-021 (noted there).
- Chart forms (line, bars, colors, motion) are left to `design.md`.
